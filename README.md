# Diabetic-Foot-Ulcer-Detection
A smart system for early detection of diabetic foot ulcers using AI, deep learning, and multi-sensor data (temperature, pressure, heart rate, humidity, BMI). Includes COMSOL-based sensor design and real-time monitoring for preventive healthcare.
This final year project focuses on the early detection of Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFUs) using a multidisciplinary approach combining AI, deep learning, sensor integration, and simulation.

The system is designed to monitor diabetic patients and detect early symptoms of foot ulcers, reducing the risk of severe complications such as infections and amputations. A multisensor framework is developed to collect real-time physiological and environmental data from the patient. Commercial sensors are used alongside custom-designed pressure sensors created and simulated using COMSOL Multiphysics for accurate foot pressure monitoring.

The sensor array includes modules to measure foot temperature, pressure, humidity, ambient conditions, heart rate (using ESP32 and pulse sensors), and body mass index (BMI). These parameters are critical in identifying potential ulcer development conditions.

Collected data is processed using AI and deep learning models to detect abnormal patterns. The system includes image-based ulcer detection and physiological data analysis for comprehensive risk prediction. Real-time monitoring and analysis enhance early diagnosis and enable preventive action before serious symptoms appear.

This project also explores the potential for remote health monitoring and integration into smart healthcare systems. It is designed to be cost-effective, scalable, and adaptable to real-world clinical and home-care settings.

The combination of sensor technology, machine learning, and biomedical modeling aims to provide a practical solution to one of the most common complications in diabetic patients. The system contributes to proactive healthcare management by supporting early intervention, improving patient outcomes, and reducing the burden on medical infrastructure.
